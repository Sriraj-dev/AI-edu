Lets generalise the techniques we would be using during the data preprocessing and training the
model.

* Understand the target of the problem clearly and keep this in mind while building 
train/dev/test sets.

1. Drop the rows in which we dont have output value(output value is NaN)
- Split the data into training & validation sets
- (Be careful while splitting the data keeping in mind the data distribution &
 target objective of the model bcuz dev & test sets must include examples which will test our 
 objective.)
2. Handle the missing data by dropping columns or Imputing.
3. Understand numerical and categorical varaibles.
4. Handle categorical varaiables by One-HotEncoding or OrdinalEncoding
(Check the possible categories in training / validation sets properly before encoding)
5.
